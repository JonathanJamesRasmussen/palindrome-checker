# Palindrome Checker
This algorithm is comprised of one JavaScript function, called `palindrome` that will return true or false based upon whether the string passed into it is a palindrome or not.  A palindrome in this case is defined as a sequence of characters that is the same forwards as backwords.

This algorithm will strip out all spaces and special characters as well as convert the entire string to lowercase, so the user doensn't have to worry about ommitting certain characters.

## Usage
In order to use this algorithm, copy the javascript into whatever environment you'd like to use, and then run `palindrome(<str>)`, where `<str>` is whatever you want to check for being a palindrome.
